function defects = computeDefects(timeStep, state, stateDerivatives)
    % This function computes the defects for
    % direct transcription using the Trapezoidal Rule.

    % Inputs:
    %   timeStep: scalar = time step
    %   state: [nStates, nGrid] = matrix of states
    %   stateDerivatives: [nStates, nGrid-1] = matrix of
    %                                          state derivatives

    % Outputs:
    %   defects: [nStates, nGrid-1] = matrix of defects
