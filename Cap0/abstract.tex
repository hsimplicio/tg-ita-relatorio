This work presents the development of a MATLAB library for solving trajectory optimization problems using the trapezoidal direct collocation method. The library aims to simplify the resolution of such problems, allowing users to focus solely on modeling without the need to implement the mathematical logic of the numerical solution. The implementation is validated through three test cases: a simple one-dimensional motion problem, the classic brachistochrone problem, and an eVTOL aircraft climb trajectory optimization problem. The obtained results are compared with analytical solutions, when available, and with results from the literature using other optimization software, demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed library. The work contributes to the field of optimal control by providing a tool that facilitates the implementation of numerical solutions for trajectory optimization problems, being particularly useful for aerospace engineering applications and related fields.
